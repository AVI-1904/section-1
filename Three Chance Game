Game Overview
This is a Three Chance game designed for two players: Player X and Player Y. The goal is to generate random numbers, sum them up, and determine who has the highest total score. The game is simple, fun, and quick to play.

Rules of the Game
1- Turns and Chances:

Each player gets 3 chances to generate numbers.
Players take turns, starting with Player X, followed by Player Y.
2- Number Generation:

Each click of the "Generate Number" button creates a random number between 1 and 10.
The generated numbers are displayed, and their total sum is updated automatically.
3- Game Flow:

Player X starts by clicking their "Generate Number" button three times.
Once Player X has taken all three chances, their button is disabled, and Player Y's button is enabled.
Player Y repeats the same process, generating three random numbers.
4-  Winner Declaration:

After both players have completed their turns, the game compares their total sums:
If Player X's sum > Player Y's sum, Player X wins.
If Player Y's sum > Player X's sum, Player Y wins.
If both sums are equal, the game declares a tie.
5-  Restarting the Game:

After a winner is declared, a "Restart Game" button appears.
Clicking the restart button resets everything, and a new game begins.
Special Features
6-  Progress Bar:

A visual indicator shows how many turns each player has completed.
7-  Leaderboard:
